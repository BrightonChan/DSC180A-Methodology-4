**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered this quarter is using LLMs to categorize transaction memos into different categories like education, food and beverages, and so on.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
With our categorization model trained, we can now move on to predicting the probability of the default score. We would also have to look at the inflow database to look at income flow.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Quarter 1 is more about categorization of transactions. In quarter 2, we would look more into prediction of the actual credit risk, potentially we could also compare this to the accuracy of the FICO score which is the system most people are using right now.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
We have trained the baseline model using logistic regression and TFIDF as well as an LLM model so far. It would be interesting to see if we can also compare it with other LLM models like Bert and FinBert to see if there's a difference in test accuracy.
